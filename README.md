# Home_Sales

# Overview
SparkSQL was used to determine key metrics about home sales data. Spark was used to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table. Finally, Spark was used to verify that the table was uncached. 

# Steps
A temporary table homesales was created and used to answer the following questions:

- What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
- What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
- What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
- What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
